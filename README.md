# TypeScript Off-by-one Error

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in TypeScript when iterating over arrays.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.
